# dietapp
An intelligent, ML-powered diet planning application that generates personalized 15-day Indian meal plans based on user health goals, dietary preferences, and nutritional needs.

Built with Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn, this system combines real-world nutrition science with machine learning (k-Nearest Neighbors) to recommend culturally appropriate, balanced, and non-repeating meals from a dataset of 800+ Indian dishes.

🔍 Key Features:
✅ ML-Based Recommendation Engine: Uses NearestNeighbors and StandardScaler to find nutritionally similar dishes.
✅ Personalized Goals: Supports Weight Loss, Weight Gain, and Bodybuilding with macro-targeting.
✅ Diet & Allergy Aware: Filters for Veg/Non-Veg, allergies (e.g., nuts, milk), and regional cuisine (North, South, Gujarati, etc.).
✅ Indian-Centric Design: Respects meal timing (heavy lunch), regional diversity, and glycemic index (GI) for diabetes safety.
✅ User-Friendly UI: Clean, responsive interface built with Streamlit — easy to use and deploy.
✅ Downloadable Plan: Export your meal plan as CSV for real-life use.
